custom class:


	String class:
		Attributes:
			text, index

		Actions:
			substring(), charAt() ....

		str1 = "Cybertek";
		str2 = "Java";
		..

	Car class:
		Attributes:

		Actions:
			drive(), break()...


object: came from class, instance of a class

	car1: Toyota
	car2: BMW
	car3: Tesla
	...


instance: each object has its own copy

instance variables: object variables
				each object has its own copy of instance variables


instance methods: object methods
			does not have static keyword

		Attribute: name, color, gender, age, breed....
		Actions: scratch(), breakThings(), jump(), eat(), drink(), meow()....
				 setInfo(), getInfo()
