                - Assume that ;

        - You live  Houston city in TX state.
        - You will go to a trip and you have 3 choice

                == Distance from Houston ==

        San Antonio   250 mil
        Dallas		  300 mil
        Austin.       200 mil

                - Unit Price Of Fuel is $ 3.06
                - Average Fuel Consumption is 3.2 gal/100 mil
                - Max speed is 80 mph
                - Min speed is 40 mph

        According to this information

        Ask the user :

        1. Do you want to start the car ? (as boolean)

        true : Continue trip
        false: Give a message " see you later "


        2.if user continues to trip

        Which city do you want to go ?  (as String)
        List of cities
        San Antonio
        Dallas
                Austin

        According to user answer assign your distance related values.

                If user input is out of this cities assign as distance 0

        3.if user choose one of these city assign your speed  60 mph as default

        Then Give this info message for user (as int)

        to increase the speed press 0
        to decrease the speed press 1

        Option -1 ----- if user press 0

        Ask user "How much would you like to increase the speed?"

        If totalSpeed is bigger than maxspeed don't do any changes in speed
        otherwise you can change(increase) speed according to input

        Example :

        Default speed:60 mph
        User Input :30 mph

        output: "It is not allowed.Your speed is " + 60

        Default speed:60 mph
        User Input :15 mph

        output: "Your speed is increased!"+ 75

        Option -2 -----if user press 1

        Ask user "How much would you like to decrease the speed?"

        If totalSpeed is smaller than minSpeed don't do any changes in speed
        otherwise you can change(decrease) speed according to input

        Example :

        Default speed:60 mph
        User Input :30 mph

        output: "It is not allowed.Your speed is " + 60

        Default speed:60 mph
        User Input :15 mph

        output: "Your speed is increased!"+ 45

        Option -3 -----if user press any number other than 0 or 1

        Give an info message

        "Your speed is not changed!" + $speed

        Ex : 	"Your speed is not changed!" + 60



        3.According to all inputs print out this result

        EstimatedTime  		 : distance/speed

        TotalFuelConsumption : EstimatedTime*Average Fuel Consumption;

        TotalPriceForFuel	 : TotalFuelConsumption*Unit Price Of Fuel

                ======= Example ========

        Inputs : true , San Antonio,1,10

                ========== Results ===========
        Estimated Time         : 5.0
        Total Fuel Consumption : 16.0 gal
        Total Price Price      : $48.96


        1-	Question :Do you want to start the car ? (as boolean)
        Answer   :true

        2-	Question : Which city do you want to go ? (as String)
        List of cities
        San Antonio
        Dallas
                Austin
        Answer   :	San Antonio

        3-	Question : If you want to increase the speed press 0   (as int)
        if you want to decrease the speed press 1
        Answer.  : 		1
        4-	Question :  How much would you like to decrease the speed?(as int)
        Answer   :				10
        Info	 : Your speed is decreased! 50
