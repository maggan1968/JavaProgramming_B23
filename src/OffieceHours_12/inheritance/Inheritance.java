        Inheritance IS-A RelationShip
        SuperClass -- Parent -- Base  : the class whose features are inherited
        SubClass   -- Child  -- Derived  : the class that inherits the other class
        What is inherited ?
            - All public and  protected variables and methods
            - All default variables and methods (if parent and child are in same package)
            - Private variables can not be inherited (access with getter and setter)
            - Constructors are not inherited
        Constructors
            - In the inheritance , the parent class constr always executes before child constructor
        How can we call Parent Class Constr ?
            - use super keyword
            - if child does not call parent class constr, Java will call parent class default constr
            - if parent class has parameterized constr , child class MUST call it explicitly
            super : refers to parent class object
            super() :refers Parent class constr
                    - must be in first statement in child class constr
                    - we can not use this() and super() in the same constr
        Overriding
             Why we need ?
                -Sometimes a subclass inherits a method from its superclass,
                 but the method is inadequate for the subclassâ€™s purpose.
            - There MUST be IS A realtion ship.Do it inside Child class
            - Parameters , returnType, methodName MUST be same
            - Access Modifier needs to be same or MORE VISIBLE
                - public         public
                - protected      protected OR public
                - default        default OR protected OR public
                - private        CAN NOT BE INHERITED
            - Private , final , static methods can not be OVERRIDDEN
		Advantages:
			less memory
			less codes
			easy to maintain
			improves the reusability
