    /*
    final : is non-access modifier
            - we can use it with variables - method - class
            final variables-- to make constant.it is not possible to assgin new value for this varaible
            final methods  -- to prevent overriding
            final class    -- to prevent inheritance
            variables :
                - if variable is final , its value CAN NOT modified
                - when  variable is final we need to initiliza it
                    - constructor
                    - same statement
                NOTE : if variable is final you can not use setter for this.You can use only getter method.
                       final variables are immutable.
                       Read-Only
            methods : A final method can not be overridden
            class   : A final class can not be extended
                      Do we have any final class ?
                      - Yes String. it is immutable
