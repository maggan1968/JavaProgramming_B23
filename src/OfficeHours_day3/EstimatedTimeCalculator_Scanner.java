   							- Ask the User
   								- Car speed
   											should be 40 - 80 mph
   										-> if user enters smaller than minSpeed
   																or
   													 	   bigger than maxSpeed
   										-   assign for speed 60 as default
   										-   otherwise assign for speed userInput(int)
   								- startingpoint(string) and destination(string)
   								- distance between this two points(double)
   								According to this information calculate triptime;
   								Formula of estimatedTime = distance/speed;
   							   	Ex :
   										Inputs :50,San Antonio,Dallas,300
   										"The Estimated Time Of Arrival is 6.0 hours from San Antonio to Dallas "
